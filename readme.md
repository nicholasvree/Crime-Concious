## Summary
Crime Conscious is a mapping web-based application that enables users to identify criminal activity in a given location.  In an effort to raise community awareness and enable informed decisions, this app allows users to filter by location, type of crime, year, and radius in order to pin point their area of interest.  Employing the Google Maps and CPD Data APIs, Crime Conscious delivers precise, reliable intel to anyone with internet access.  In a world full of mixed messages and lukewarm uncertainty, this program intends to supplement the lives of its users with the hard, cold facts.
